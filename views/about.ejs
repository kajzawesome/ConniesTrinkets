        <p>
          Grandma Connie built a home filled with laughter, kindness, and the smell of warm bread from the oven.
          She taught us that love isn’t shown in grand gestures, but in the little things we do every day.
        </p>
        <p>
          This site is a way for us to carry her spirit forward — by sharing the things she treasured most
          and the memories that came with them.
